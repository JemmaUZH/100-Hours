A Notion-style color-filling tool that helps users track progress in learning new skills, providing visual positive feedback to enhance the learning experience.

ðŸŒŸ Inspiration
This project is inspired by the "100-Hour Learning Principle":

Core Idea: By dedicating 100 hours to deeply studying a subject, one can build a solid knowledge framework and achieve noticeable improvement.
Visualizing Progress: By filling in colors, users can track their daily learning hours or completed tasks, making progress tangible.
Motivation Boost: As you stay consistent, the grid gradually fills up, offering positive reinforcement, increasing motivation, and making learning more enjoyable!

This tool can be used to:

Track study hours (e.g., studying 1 hour daily for 100 days)
Monitor learning progress (e.g., measuring mastery of concepts)
Set custom goals for gradual self-improvement
